            <p>Hello! I’m Andrea Lianne C. Magdaet, an 18-year-old student at Fellowship Baptist College, where I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Kabankalan in Negros Occidental, Philippines, I’m deeply passionate about both technology and design.
            <br>
            <br>In addition to my studies in IT, I have a keen interest and skill set in graphic design. Over the years, I’ve developed proficiency in various design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite and other graphic software. Whether it’s creating compelling visuals, designing user interfaces, or developing brand identities, I enjoy translating ideas into engaging and aesthetically pleasing designs.
            <br>
            <br>My dual focus on IT and graphic design allows me to approach projects from a unique perspective, blending technical expertise with creative flair. I’m eager to apply my skills to solve problems, enhance user experiences, and contribute to innovative solutions.
            <br>
            <br>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m excited to showcase my work and share my journey with you!</p>
